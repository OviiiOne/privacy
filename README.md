This repository serves as a way for non-english speaking folks to access our privacy policy and become aware of what and how their data is collected and proceeded by our systems.

### Adding a language
We'd like to support as much languages as possible. If yours isn't listed here, you're more than welcome to translate it. If you're that kind and wish to help, here's some guidance!

1) Translate the document which you can find [here](https://suggester.js.org/#/legal). Make sure to keep the markdown (bold text, codeblocks, headers) and to not translate names, including Suggester's, its devs' and the extra bots mentioned at the end. Additionally, translating the last paragraph is not needed.
2) Once you are done, submit a Pull Request on this repository adding your translated version as a file. Name it with your language's name and with the `.md` extension. Make sure to mention if you'd like credit or not (if you don't, we'll assume you do).
3) We'll review your PR as soon as possible!

### Rewards
If you don't already have it, you'll receive the Translator acknowledgment on the `.verify` command as a thank you. If you do, you'll receive a custom acknowledgment of your choice on that same command.
